  <div class="content">
    <p>Early workhouses were non-residential work sites, but purpose-built residential workhouses emerged in the 18th century. Designs included separate accommodation for different groups and exercise yards. Architectural plans included courtyard, square/cruciate, corridor, and pavilion block concepts.</p>

  <img src="C:\Users\osborn\Desktop\222.png" alt="Living Conditions Image" style="width:80%;">
  <div class="content">
    <p>Accommodation varied based on individual groups such as the elderly, children, able-bodied males, and females, but many workhouses opted for mixed accommodation due to unpredictability in numbers. Living conditions were deliberately kept below the lowest standard of an independent laborer to discourage dependency.</p>

  <img src="C:\Users\osborn\Desktop\resize.webp" alt="Food and Diet Image" style="width:80%;">
  <div class="content">
    <p>The food provided was very basic and monotonous, often in limited quantities. Staples might include bread, gruel, and some cheap vegetables.</p>

  <summary>Admission and Daily Routine</summary>
  <!-- 在这里插入图片 -->
  <img src="C:\Users\osborn\Desktop\stonecracker.jpg" alt="Admission and Daily Routine Image" style="width:80%;">
  <div class="content">
    <p>People seeking to enter a workhouse would apply through a relieving officer and receive a ticket for admission. Upon arrival, families were separated, their personal clothes stored away, and uniforms issued. The day typically began early with a bell at 6 am (7 am in winter), followed by breakfast, work, dinner, more work, supper, and then bedtime at 8 pm. The work assigned varied by gender, with women doing domestic chores and men involved in hard labor like stone breaking or bone crushing.</p>

<details class="collapsible">
<summary>Death and Burial</summary>
<!-- 在这里插入图片 -->
<div class="content">
  <p>When an inmate died, their family was notified for funeral arrangements. If the family couldn't afford it, the Guardians arranged a burial in a local cemetery, often in the cheapest possible coffin or shroud and sometimes in un-consecrated ground.</p>

<div class="content">
  <p>Medical supervision was slow to improve and was often provided by doctors who struggled to establish a private practice. Nurses were generally untrained, and nursing duties were often performed by elderly female inmates.</p>
